 No, I g I pointed you in the direction of where the money. Yeah. And then you hook me up with a training out of a Z magna ft connector.

00:07:38:02 - 00:08:03:09

That's right. You tablet. Yep. Yep. So you've been a huge part of my life. This even though we don't talk very much, which the podcast first podcast I did was with you. That's right. On your podcast Chronicles. Chronicles that was lit, you know. Yeah we but you know, I mean it was all like reciprocal because you got me into the UFC gym, you know what I'm saying?

00:08:03:09 - 00:08:05:23
Unknown
And that like

00:08:05:23 - 00:08:12:17
Unknown
it in a lot of ways. So that was the beginning of me finding myself in jujitsu,

00:08:12:17 - 00:08:28:23
Unknown
meaning that, you know, of course, you know, start to have Gracie go to trials, finish with, you know, with heroes, get my get my black belt, you know what I'm saying? Then start teaching over at house and then get the opportunities here in the UK with Gracie.

00:08:28:23 - 00:08:49:21
Unknown
But how Roundhay, Leeds and everything out here. And so, you know, it's been really just kind of fantastic. But, you know, I can't tell you how much legitimacy working at the San Bruno UFC gym has for me anywhere else that I went in the world. You know what I mean? When they were like, Well, where have you taught it?

00:08:49:21 - 00:09:10:12
Unknown
And I'd be like, Well, UFC, GM, San Bruno, they like you talk to UFC gym now. Obviously they know it's not like Vegas, you feel me, but it's still, you know what I mean? And for me, you know, the the format was so open at the San Bruno spot that I had to decide how do I really want warmups to go?

00:09:10:14 - 00:09:27:24
Unknown
What does it really mean? Have a warm up, You know, I mean, especially when you come from how grace is, where they try to break your soul before you even touch anybody. You know what I mean? So how how heavy? What? The warm ups. How light do I want the warm ups? What? You know what I mean. And then that led to me getting the shot to be over at USF, where I taught for a while.

00:09:27:25 - 00:09:49:00
Unknown
You know what I mean? So it was just really mutually fantastic. And I appreciate you and I'm proud of you So happy to see you get your black belt. So happy to see you. You know, navigate to you. It's very impressive. It's very. Yeah, Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah. And I love everything you do. Like

00:09:49:00 - 00:10:12:11
Unknown
for the people who don't know, you've been a huge leader as a, you know, a black male leader for here in the Bay Area and just throughout the U.S. with your jujitsu chess program, you had, you were putting together different art or museum exhibits, just the people that just let people know our history.

00:10:12:13 - 00:10:32:19
Unknown
You know, we're actually bringing in a lot of guests here. Your podcast and your Bishop Chronicles podcast is something that I when I was driving for Uber and you were on the radio like, I just you were a staple any time I was driving to pick people up and like every single passenger I had was filling your show too.

00:10:32:20 - 00:10:58:26
Unknown
They like, actually, I love what you said. Some of the stories I had on were like a little crazy. I was like, my God, these. But some of them were, you know, they were like, they were enlightening. You always start off with your your stoicism part of the day. Yeah. That's kind of why when you and you have a group going on for it was the Resilient Men group.

00:10:58:28 - 00:11:07:23
Unknown
And I kind of want to understand, you know, what's that that's all about. Who are you looking to help and how are you helping these these men?

00:11:07:23 - 00:11:18:13
Unknown
Yeah. No, no, no. Thank you. I appreciate that. So, you know, Bishop Chronicles, ironically, is I've been on a crazy hiatus, but me and my realm are going to make it pop up soon.

00:11:18:13 - 00:11:34:21
Unknown
And everybody who's going, you keep saying that and I don't. And I agree. I agree. I've been dragging. But I've been dragging because I've been living and trying to figure out, you know, what exactly am I doing with the podcast and what kind of content do I want to deliver. But the Resilient Men's Group was kind of born from that.

00:11:34:21 - 00:11:58:06
Unknown
And so what it's about is, you know, I got into the stoicism because I had a near-death experience, and then right after that I ended up getting divorced. And so like that whole situation shook up my sense of my identity. Like, I really didn't know who I was because I had been married for 23 years and I had known her for 30 years.

00:11:58:06 - 00:12:23:11
Unknown
Right. And I'm 53, so I more than half of my life like, who am I? Like, if I'm not married and if I'm not, you know what I mean? Around my kids all the time. Like, who am I? And so it took me a while and Stoicism played a significant role in me finding myself. My direct link in the stoicism actually comes through jujitsu through a guy named Abraham Marti shout out to the Dominican Republic, who he was doing a seminar at Heroes.

00:12:23:11 - 00:12:42:01
Unknown
I was supposed to go meet with him and my split happened, like right before the weekend he arrived and he was expecting me to be there to interview him. I was like messed up. I was not at the interview. A nobody. And he was like, Bro, he called like, Where are you at? And I was like, I'm having a split.

00:12:42:01 - 00:12:53:28
Unknown
It's a bad time to go. And then he was like, Bro, you got to be more stoic. And I was like, What? He was like, You got to be more stoic. And I was like, What does that mean? Like, I don't I don't know what that means. And he was like, Man, you know, you got to look into it.

00:12:53:28 - 00:13:09:04
Unknown
But, you know, bottom line is, my life isn't perfect either. I got all this other stuff going on, but I'm here and I'm training and you need to be here. You need to be training. Now, we're not doing the interview. And so when I got off the phone, I immediately went on a YouTube and started looking at Stoicism, which is something I never really did.

00:13:09:04 - 00:13:32:28
Unknown
I never really used YouTube before then to find out a thing. But obviously YouTube had tons of different cool things on Stoicism, and that led to me just diving into the wormhole of that philosophy system. And what a lot of people don't know is because of people like, you know. AK Black, also known as Jim Wilson over there at Physique Man, it's like I got into reading about philosophy at a really early age.

00:13:32:28 - 00:14:04:08
Unknown
So I had read a lot of the Pre-socratic stuff. I read Aristotle, I had read Plato, I had read lots of Eastern and Western philosophy like in Depth, Confucianism, Daoism, you know what I mean? Lots of different stuff. So it was easier for me, I think, to understand stoic philosophy. I don't want to say better than others. I'll just say because of all the philosophy I had been reading, it was easy to understand and I became a serious believer in the way that philosophy works, which is around a lot of practice.

00:14:04:10 - 00:14:28:17
Unknown
Like it's not that stoic ideas are cool because you'll find people online who quote Marcus Aurelius or Seneca or whatever, but it's really that like they have different practices for different things you're trying to do. So if you struggle with fear, they are stoic practices for fear. If you if you struggle with anger management, they have ways to curb your anger, sadness, ways to like, look at your sadness in a better perspective so that you're not harming yourself.

00:14:28:17 - 00:14:45:25
Unknown
You know what I mean? I know a lot of people that cut themselves that you know what I mean? That I've tried to kill themselves, you know, even recently and stuff like that. Right. And even even express your joy in moderation. Right. Like, it's not that you're not a joyful person, but like, let's take let's take just the bay, for example.

00:14:46:01 - 00:15:18:07
Unknown
Right. If if the 40 Niners lose the Super Bowl stuff going to be on fire. Right. If they win a Super Bowl stuff on the on fire. So these are two different extreme expressions of anger and joy. Right. So it's about moderation. And once I started doing those practices, my life just became much better. And I started studying it so heavily that within a few years I was able to like lecture at it at Stanford University, which was amazing, you know?

00:15:18:09 - 00:15:38:21
Unknown
And then they invited me back to do another talk. And I just recently did a talk out here in the UK, I think called the next 45, which is created by this amazing guy named Mike Bates, who is is the is the owner of the school that I do some work at right now called Gracie Bar Roundhay Leeds.

00:15:38:23 - 00:15:56:05
Unknown
It's an amazing school. They have 500 students, 500 like this school is big and it's rapidly growing. Yeah, I know, but this guy is amazing. And he created this thing called the next 45, where people get to 45, they start falling off, thinking their lives over, thinking they're done. And he's like, No, you got to look at the next 45.

00:15:56:08 - 00:16
