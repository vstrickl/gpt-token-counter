 distract them. Right. And so, like, we have to learn to be at peace with who we are. And then everything starts to open up.

00:35:53:03 - 00:36:19:20
Unknown
Yeah, I think being in nature is super helpful for that because in the home, it's not just easy for us to be distracted by all of the technology and the electronics, the TV, our phone, things that we have to do around the house to clean. But we're already so removed from nature being, especially if you live in an urban environment, right?

00:36:19:20 - 00:36:48:13

So soon as I set foot on the sand or put my feet in the grass, I get a pletely different energy shift and I don't need music at that point. My music is the way I leaves or it's be yo, you spit in bars right now because like, like before I, before I before I started coming back and forth out here a lot and trying to hang out here.

00:36:48:16 - 00:37:11:10

I used to, I used to jogging Linda Mah beach in Pacifica and I would get up outrun full span of the beach, down one side and back and then I would take my shoes off and I would walk with the waves just kind of going like, like ankle, ankle high, you know what I'm saying? And I never better than when I was doing that.

00:37:11:12 - 00:37:31:23
Unknown
You know, I never felt better than when I was doing that. And there's this thing if you go on YouTube, I think it's called the Shuman residence Resonance, and it is the frequency of the earth. And so a lot of times what I'll do is I'll sit on the earth or stand barefoot on the earth. It's called grounding, right?

00:37:31:23 - 00:37:53:08
Unknown
Because the energy from the earth, it goes through your body. I'm not talking like hippie stuff. I'm talking about life, actual, measurable science. It's called grounding. And it's good for your body to be on the earth so you can stand on grass or sand or whatever it's called grounding. Right? And I would listen to the Earth's frequency. It's called the Schumann Resonance.

00:37:53:11 - 00:38:22:01
Unknown
And if you listen to that with headphones on and you just sit still, it's unbelievable. It's unbelievable. And it's incredibly good for your actual brain. Right? So, you know, the Stoics were about nature, the Buddhists were about nature. The Sufis were about nature. And you find, you know, even if you look at things, you know, ancient like Freemasonry, you find that a lot of the things that they were doing were connected to reflecting nature.

00:38:22:04 - 00:39:11:23
Unknown
And at that time it was becoming modern society. And so it's very powerful to see how being still in nature has moved so many societies. And then we get to this place where so high technology that we've forgotten our own origins, right. And forgotten own roots, it's powerful. Well, I'm going to try to not be so political, but it's going to be hard with my this next statement, which is it reminds me a lot of, you know, just African ancestry and how we were removed from that, from like those traditions and that history and those spiritual practices in a sense.

00:39:11:23 - 00:39:37:10
Unknown
And and it's like, you know, I wouldn't say I'm doing a lot of research to get back to that point, but I love I do love technology for connecting us to those different cultures so that I can see and I can understand, this is what, you know, people from this area would do, like especially as a black woman, this is how we would actually take care of our hair.

00:39:37:13 - 00:40:05:28
Unknown
This is how we would take care of our bodies. This is how we would eat. This is how we would connect with nature. And even though, you know, I'm still removed here in the United States, I'm using technology as a way to open myself up to different worlds. It's still it's humbling to know how removed we are from all that ancient history, that ancient knowledge that served us to be more grounded, as you said.

00:40:06:00 - 00:40:30:20
Unknown
Yeah. No, no, no. It's it's a big deal, you know? And so this is where we bring it back to jiu jitsu, right? Because a lot of my health now actually comes from Gracie Jujitsu. Right? You know, I was lucky enough to meet and interview Ariel Gracie back when the UFC was brand new, back when Boyce was in there mopping and choking Fu's out.

00:40:30:22 - 00:40:53:25
Unknown
And, you know, I remember Maureen telling me about the Gracie Diet. You know, I remember Marianne telling me about the importance of juicing and saying, you know, what is it, Guarana, that that other like Berry, You know what I'm saying? And so, like, I remember having Guarana for the first time and they were laughing at me because I hadn't eaten that day.

00:40:54:00 - 00:41:35:12
Unknown
And then I was I was drinking. They were like, this was about to be off the off the Richter, you know. And I was but, you know, I juice now like everybody knows me for juicing my actual juice. Not juicing like, you know. Yeah, yeah. I'm not juice, you know, I just, I had in high school and still here, but, but I, you know, I juice a lot like almost every day, you know, I have natural juice and then I'm Bishop Chronicles.

00:41:35:12 - 00:41:54:18
Unknown
I'm pretty sure it's still up. I got to interview Ralston Gracie, who basically became a fanatic about the doctor save diet, and he's blended it with the Gracie Diet to improve health and stuff like that. And so he and I, you know, that's my brother for real. Like we still talk about all of that stuff and more every day, right?

00:41:54:18 - 00:42:19:06
Unknown
But this house, it is interesting because I've known I've I've met Halston when I was a white belt and he really randomly pops up like, I'll just see him like, real like, wow, Nice to see you. Real. It is kind of crazy. I got to look where you are. Yeah, you're right. Right. He's just doing amazing and he'll just pop up Jake the subject.

00:42:19:06 - 00:42:40:00
Unknown
So. Yeah, true story. So I'm chilling, right? I'm like, Yo, man, I got to. I got to you know, I was. I was taking this this woman I'm still with on a on a great date. I got to figure some cool. So I'm like, I'm to take her to Muir Woods. We're going to walk. We're going to go for a walk in the woods, maybe go to your beach.

00:42:40:03 - 00:43:02:08
Unknown
So we walk in. Muir were chillin when the cuts of Muir Woods. I don't even know where I was, You understand? I literally don't. We're walking around. It's a great day. you want to have a sit for a bit? Yeah So we're just sitting on this bench and we're chillin now. I had told Ross and I said, Hey man, you know, I won't be chilling with this lady.

00:43:02:08 - 00:43:20:15
Unknown
And, you know, I was thinking maybe like, have you ever, like, cook dinner for somebody? But like, I was like, what if I broke you off? Right? Left you at the house? I'd go on the whole walk thing, and I come back and you, like, cook dinner. He was like, Yeah, we can figure that out. But our schedules are too crazy and we didn't figure it out.

00:43:20:21 - 00:43:47:08
Unknown
So anyway, I'm sitting here chillin, we talking on a bench, and all of a sudden we see this dude in the distance and he's running with his shirt off at a really fast pace and he gets close. And I'm like, Ralston, He's like the super lady. it's like he looks at me. He's like, Is that. Is that.

00:43:47:08 - 00:44:11:12
Unknown
What were you talking about? I was like, Yeah, that's her. It's like it was, yeah, you know, but we couldn't get figured out yet. It was hilarious. But Ralston is so wise. He's always studying and he's always, like, trying to study the body, food, the earth. And he's just. He's an impressive dude, man. He is an impressive dude.

00:44:11:12 - 00:44:30:24
Unknown
Match That shot to that. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I always have. I don't. You know, we're not tight like you. Like I just see him. I'll just see him randomly. But I always have cool converse Asians with him. You know, any time I do talk to him and catch up and it's kind of like, you're still traded, you know?

00:44:30:27 - 00:44:56:01
Unknown
Yeah. This is amazing, man. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's cool. But yeah, this is how jujitsu can save your life, right? That there are limits to what you do you can and should do for you. Maybe mentally and emotionally. And you should always look for therapy, look for support groups and things like that. But what jujitsu does do to enrich your mind, to open your heart to your own potential, to to to test your body and help show you what you're capable of.

00:44:56:08 - 00:45:18:01
Unknown
I don't think there's a better tool in the modern world than jujitsu for that. I just don't. And you know what? Look, this is no disrespect to anybody who likes hoops or soccer or Parcheesi or whatever they get into. I'm just saying I don't think that anything will help you grow as quickly into learning about who you are and what you're capable of as Brazilian jiu jitsu.

00:45:18:03 - 00:45:44:12
Unknown
You know, I just don't. Yeah, I, I agree. And I think you know, we're both bias and I'll do that. Yeah you know I'll be open to bias but I it too because you know there's always this social component with
