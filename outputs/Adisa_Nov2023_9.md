What start talking about like, you know, I'll be like, Yo, so like, what is one aspect of your life that you know, you're letting yourself down on and why do you think that is? And then everybody kind of goes through where they're failing themselves and why they think that is. And then to watch these men support each other.

01:15:23:13 - 01:15:41:13

I mean, they're all essentially strangers, you know what I'm saying? We're all essentially strangers. And they'll be like, Hey, man, I understand what you're saying. But I think if you did this, you probably achieve it faster. Or, you know, don't be so hard on yourself because, you know, this is also possible. And it's just beautiful, like to see that stuff happen.

01:15:41:15 - 01:16:05:06

And I think that that, you know, I believe that every person, you know, has been through something that would have broken. You just don't know that story. You could have come from their childhood, could come from their teenage years. But it comes young adult could have come as a O.G. like you just don't know. You haven't had that story told to you yet.

And so this is one of the reasons why be chill with people because. Everybody is a survivor of something incredible. Everybody is survivor of something incredible. And when I see these guys going back forth, helping each other from the heart without judgment, it's it's just it's just magnificent. I never get tired of seeing that. You know what I mean?

01:16:28:00 - 01:16:57:04

I never get tired of seeing this. Beautiful. That's awesome. That's awesome. Any revelations for your journey doing this work, anything that you grew from just by putting this this group together, by listening their stories? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I always knew like, I was like, okay, I got this stoic outline and know what I want to do, etc., etc. But.

01:16:57:07 - 01:17:36:05

Man, even as the guy who's the facilitator of the group, I lead by sharing my with my own vulnerability, right? With my own shortcomings, with my own pain points, with my own struggles. And I do that intentionally because, again, I'm not trying to be seen as like some type of guru who's got it all figured out. And sometimes they're they're they're their suggestions to me are groundbreaking.

01:17:36:07 - 01:18:09:01
Unknown
They're Their suggestions to me are mind blowing. Their suggestions to me are supremely inspiring, you know? So, I mean, you know, it's just kind of a reflection of that whole thing. Well, let me find this quote real quick. You know, I just want to say, for the guys at home, I had this bag of plantain chips that I spilled all over the ground.

01:18:09:03 - 01:18:39:00

And my rabbit is currently acting as a vacuum cleaner for me, for my little combs that I couldn't pick up. She loves the plantation. I hope she doesn't die. Yes. What is this, Rabbits. Right now they're not. But I just. She's had them before. She intelligence and other things. But says just do this, this, this, this thing. And this was actually the first person that to teach me.

01:18:39:00 - 01:19:05:14

This was actually my fiancee and but it's true of all human beings. And this is the beauty you see in me is a reflection of you. That's Rumi. The beauty you see in me is a reflection of you. And so when I'm talking to these guys as the one that's supposed to be the facilitator, and they're reflecting all this beauty to me that I didn't expect, that I that I didn't even show up for.

01:19:05:16 - 01:19:35:03
Unknown
I'm trying to show up as the helper, and then you get the help. That's just that's gold skull. Yeah. So what's next for the group? So our group meets Mondays 7 to 9 p.m.. That's I think 11 to 1 if you're on, if you're on Pacific Standard Time 1101 on Mondays. And so we are just going for it.

01:19:35:03 - 01:20:11:27

You know, we'll have our thing going on tomorrow. You know, we rotate between like deep stoic conversations and open conversations and this upcoming one is open. So I'm just looking forward to seeing what everybody's been up to. You know, it's a wide group of people, like some dudes are like attorneys for large acquisition and merger corporations and other guys are like sound bath crystal, like Masters and others are college students and others are business leaders and others are artists.

You know what? I'm going to leave everybody with this. Do not underestimate the power of meditation and prayer do not underestimate the power of meditation and prayer. I it is a big deal. Meditation and prayer has really got me through a lot of stuff. And beyond that, I'm going to say, if you have beef with anybody or somebody's got beef with you, seek forgiveness.

01:21:38:09 - 01:22:07:04
Unknown
Be willing to apologize and and be willing to listen more because life is short, man. Life is short I've lost more people in my life in the last three years than in all the years before. Sometimes, you know, situations like cancer, you know, or other diseases that were that were that were foreseeable, sometimes very sudden right. But like, life is really short.

01:22:07:04 - 01:22:28:21

And sometimes people be holding grudges because they have this illusion of time. Like, I'll let it go in a few years, man. You don't know, if you're going to be here tomorrow, you don't know if that person is going to be here tomorrow. And like I've seen it happen where people think like they can hold this grudge until X happens and then something happens and that that never that beast never gets squashed, right?

01:22:28:22 - 01:22:50:29
Unknown
Only your ego lets you do that. So lean into meditation and prayer and embrace forgiveness because life is short and, you know, I don't God be for nobody, you know what I'm saying? I used to I used to be mad at people and I'm I just don't have the space to be angry anymore. I might not be happy.

01:22:50:29 - 01:23:06:11

I may have lost some respect. I may not necessarily want to be in contact with you, but that doesn't mean that I have beef with you. It doesn't. It doesn't mean that I'm happy with you. It just means that your energy and the way that we engage is not healthy. That's all that means. You know what I mean?

01:23:06:15 - 01:23:21:11
Unknown
And if we can find a way for it to be healthy, I'm always that door is always open for me. You know what I mean? And I'm not always the best person my damn self, you know what I mean? So I know there's aspects of me that some people, you know, are just don't want to deal with. And that's that's that's fair too, you know what I mean?

01:23:21:11 - 01:23:43:04

Like, we're all an acquired taste, you know what I mean? To some degree, we're all an acquired taste to some degree, Right. But I don't have be for nobody. Embrace your joy, embrace your peace, Look into meditation and prayer. Do it consistently. And, you know, Google Jiu-Jitsu near me. That's what you need to do and embrace your future.
