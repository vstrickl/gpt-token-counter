 a lot of group sports. You know you have a social component to basketball team football team, you know any anything where there's a team involved.

00:45:44:14 - 00:46:18:27

I just find that the the connection with martial arts specifically and jujitsu is different because it's deeper. It just comes from way. Yeah. You know, and the school that I'm on right now you know Gracie Eberhardt Roundhay Leeds is an unbelievable school because the guy who moved is, like I said, Mike Bates and T, you know, they're like, yo, like this is a community project first and a jujitsu school second, you know?

00:46:18:27 - 00:46:43:02
Unknown
I mean, like jiu jitsu is secondary to building the community. So there's so many kids, so many families, so many moms, so many dads that come and train. And it's just fantastic. I stick to see how the community engages itself. I just you know, I haven't seen anything like that. And I'm from the Bay, where is probably one of the best places on earth to learn jiu jitsu ever.

00:46:43:07 - 00:47:05:14

OC is the San Francisco Bay Area. But the level of community that I see being intentionally and consistently cultivated by Mike Bates and TI and all the coaches over there at IRL, it's amazing that anybody would tell you that when they come to GBR, they're like, This place is different and they're right. And it's not that like, you know, it's a relatively new school, right?

00:47:05:14 - 00:47:26:29
Unknown
So most of the students there are Blue Bulls. I think they only have like one purple belt. And then, you know, it's it's a few black belts, you know what I mean? Teaching, you know, and a lot of blue belt coaches teaching. But like, man, like what you get out of those classes in terms of community, I just I haven't experienced it anywhere else.

00:47:26:29 - 00:47:56:15
Unknown
And that's why I love the school so much. Yeah, that's amazing. That's amazing. Yeah, It's a beautiful thing. Well, so what are you have any memorable stories from, you know, that commuting build community building experience or even just in your life any anything from your life in jujitsu? I know you have a lot on the podcast on Bishop Chronicle podcasts.

00:47:56:15 - 00:48:35:29

If people want to follow in one anything you want to share. Four for my podcast. Yeah, yeah, let me think. Let me think. Community building Community crazy. So this is going to sound maybe corny to some people, but I really love this experience. So there's there's a young boy at the school and he has two stuffed animals and he brings them to every class and we give each other fist bumps and stuff all the time.

00:48:36:01 - 00:48:58:15
Unknown
But he always makes sure. He always asks if I can give his stuffed animals this once before and after class. And so one particular day he comes in and he is crying. I mean, this boy is shattered like he's in his gear and he's just like, and I'm like, What's wrong, bro? Because he doesn't even want to get on the mat, like, what's wrong?

00:48:58:15 - 00:49:23:18
Unknown
And he's like, my mom left Jeffrey at home. I'm like, What? Jeffrey can't make it to class, and I don't want to be here without him. And I was like, okay. I was like, But check this out. I was like, I miss Jeffrey, too. But what if, like, you got to go back to Jeffrey and like, all he's going to want to know is how was class today?

00:49:23:25 - 00:49:37:04
Unknown
You think he's going to be happy? You just tell him he's over here crying and not learning. He's going to want to see what you showed him. And if you stay over here crying all day, you're going to be like, I was crying all day. And Jeffrey is going to be like, Well, you didn't learn nothing, and that's going to be bad, man.

00:49:37:06 - 00:49:49:29
Unknown
Why don't you just come on the mat and chill and do that? And he did. He got on. He had a great class and I was like, All right, I want you to tell Jeffrey I said hello. You know what I'm saying? And show him what you learned today. And he's like, okay. And he was like, super happy.

00:49:50:02 - 00:50:16:21
Unknown
So then like, really that and Jeffrey is a SEAL and he had a snow seal, a small snow seal named Jeffrey Junior. And he was like, Look, now I got Jeffrey and Jeffrey Junior, I need you to give them fist bumps. So now I got to give him this. And once there, but like to see him be resilient at that age and choose to train, it was just really touching for me.

00:50:16:23 - 00:50:43:23
Unknown
You know what I mean? And to me, I think there's nothing better than helping seeing jujitsu teach a person that they can do something that they didn't think they could do. You know, I had a student in San Francisco who a young woman who was who was visually impaired. She was, you know, just you know, she was blind, essentially.

00:50:43:23 - 00:51:08:21
Unknown
Right. Like she uses a cane and all of that. And she I don't think she weighs Â£100. And she wanted to learn jujitsu. And so the school had asked me, you know, how do you feel about teaching like a blind woman? And I was like, This is my dream. Like, I was like, know, like, people don't know. I can't see, like, at all.

00:51:08:21 - 00:51:35:11
Unknown
Like right now I can see your form and your color. I can make nothing out like I am is bad over here. So she comes to class and everybody at USF, like, really embraced her and said, you know, I remember being afraid to do the warmups with her because I was like, What if the warmups kill her? She's never done this.

00:51:35:13 - 00:51:51:11
Unknown
You know what I mean? She may be like, What? I ain't got time for this ever. Yo, she never complained when we did that first warm up because I was watching her. Here come the push ups become the jujitsu push ups. You come, you know, say you come to Kimmy's. And I was waiting for her to be like, I'm out.

00:51:51:14 - 00:52:20:02
Unknown
Nah, stay down. And when I would show a move, she improved me because I realized that there was a big gap between what you think you're doing and saying what you're actually doing. Yes. Yeah. There's a big gap between what you're doing and what you're saying you're doing. All right. So here I'm grabbing the wrist. Grabbing the wrist.

00:52:20:02 - 00:52:40:26
Unknown
What does that mean, Grabbing the wrist with my left hand and the thumbs up, grabbing the wrist with the left hand of my thumbs down. Right. Like, you know, when you're describing a position, where is my body in proportion to their body and where am I taking them and how she improved me so much just by showing up.

00:52:40:28 - 00:53:12:13
Unknown
And I remember I would be at home just like I would run through a position. How do you teach an armbar from the closed guard to a person who can't see? I do that like I had to do that. And she became really good really quickly. And so I remember one day even as as small as she was physically, one day, a girl from a very reputable school came in and she was like, Hey, I see you guys got jiu jitsu over here.

00:53:12:13 - 00:53:31:19
Unknown
I've been meaning to come, but you know, school's crazy. Can I just drop in and take the class? And I was like, Sure. She was like, okay. I was like, How long you been training? She was like, a year, year and a half. I was like, All right, cool. I was like, You want to roll with her? And she was like, Yeah, yo could not pass this girl's closed guard at all.

00:53:31:22 - 00:53:50:21
Unknown
You could see was trippin, you know what I'm saying? She was trippin. And you know, the girl didn't finish her from the guard, but the girl could not pass. She kept her posture broke and she kept attacking every time she would go for an armbar whatever to girl was sit up. She'd go back, you know, bring her down.

00:53:50:27 - 00:54:14:15
Unknown
You know what I'm saying? She was working the sweep attempts and it was like, yo, like I started to almost cry. And then I caught myself and I said, You're only about to cry because she can't see. And by feeling that way, you're not honoring the technique that she's displaying on her own. Let her be a great champion.

00:54:14:15 - 00:54:27:24
Unknown
Like, don't add anything to it. You know what I'm saying? And when that round was over, I said, How do you feel? She was out of breath. She was like, I'm okay. And I was like, All right, I'm really proud of you. You know what I'm saying? And like, this is like the beauty of of, of this path.

00:54:27:24 - 00:54:49:13
Unknown
This is this is how, you know, people always think about how their teachers, like, make them better. But but I'm always impressed about how my students make me better. And so every time anybody who who's ever studied under me, they know how I end. Every class I shake their hand, I give them a fist pump and I say, thank you for improving me.

00:54:49:15 - 00:55:12:04
Unknown
Thank you for improving me. And that's because you, girl. Cano said that that is the purpose of the vow. You thank your opponent for improving you because you can't armbar and throw yourself. You can't choke yourself, right? You only respond to the level of pressure put upon you that takes you up to this level of greatness. So you always thank your opponent for approving you.
