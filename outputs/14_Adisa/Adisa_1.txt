Unknown
your stoicism part of the day.

00:00:29:24 - 00:00:36:27
Unknown
Yeah. That's kind of why when you and you have a group going on for it was the Resilient Men group.

00:00:36:27 - 00:00:38:11
Unknown
And I kind of want to understand,

00:00:38:11 - 00:00:38:26

you know, what's

00:00:38:26 - 00:00:41:09

Unknown
and how are you helping these these men?

00:00:46:12 - 00:00:49:25
Unknown
And so I've been out here, I've been coming back and forth for, like, four years. You know what I'm saying?

00:00:50:21 - 00:01:17:28
Unknown
And so I'm supposed to get my. My, my, my, my, our my work visa. Okay, so I apply these people want to hire me to work at this school. I'm like, cool. And then the UK embassy, this woman gave me really bad information and I went with it. Lisa just got denied. That's why I'm coming back.

00:01:18:01 - 00:01:43:02
Unknown
So I got to get up out the country real quick and reapply. You feel what I'm saying? And so, like, I just got this fucking apartment with my homey, like I'm right around the corner from the school that I teach that shit is laid out here and now I got to fucking leave. And so it's like, it's really weird, Bill, but I've been, you know, I've been working with this stuff called Stoic Philosophy for the last few years.

00:01:43:04 - 00:01:57:08
Unknown
And like, it's a big part of it is based on this thing called the dichotomy of control, which is just understanding things you can control and things you can't. And if you can't control it, you don't trip. So I was like, All right, you got to get out. I was like, By what date? They're like, This date I just went on to redo.

00:01:57:10 - 00:02:21:24
Unknown
I got my ticket, I'm headed back and I'm not tripping because I really believe, like, my future is out here and shit. You know what I mean? Like, all these happen out here. We got a big competition coming up next weekend, you know? So what competition is that it's called? I think it's called the Empire Open. It's called the Empire Opened Jujitsu here is where jujitsu used to be in the bay, like 20 years ago.

00:02:21:27 - 00:02:39:01
Unknown
So it's fun. It's a fun time. Like, schools are popping up, the school gets big, then it breaks off and that school gets big and it breaks off. And so it's like you're seeing like every you know what I mean? It's just it's great. It's well, I mean, the skill level seems to be there, too, because you got what?

00:02:39:01 - 00:03:07:09
Unknown
Well, I'm going to say just a whole UK. I'm not going to say, Are you in England or what? Yeah, I'm in. I'm in Leeds, which is like about 3 hours north of, of London, you know what I mean? And so, I mean, this is where Roger Gracie lives, you know what I'm saying? He lives in London saying like and I think also that people think of England as like super, super white, which it always will be, but it's also way more integrated than people think.

00:03:07:11 - 00:03:28:24
Unknown
So there's a lot of Irani, a lot of Dagestani, a lot of Japanese, you know what I'm saying? So there's a lot of judo out here. But I think people I mean, you know, Futaba. Futaba, the owner of the gym, she's from London. I mean, she she spent a lot of her life living on one. Exactly. And it's very it's much more multicultural than you would think.

00:03:28:27 - 00:03:46:04
Unknown
And just like, I think one, you know, the reason why I think, you know, and my instructor, Gumbi from Heroes martial Arts, I he really pointed out that, you know, the reason the Bay is so dangerous is because so many different kinds of people are there. you do kung fu? Yeah. In Chinatown, you can see what's up.

00:03:46:09 - 00:04:07:13
Unknown
you do judo. There's Willie Cahill, There's San Jose State. you do jujitsu. There's a whole bunch of Gracie's. And you know what I mean? And they're students. Students? You know what I'm saying? So, like. Like London and England in general is the same. You know what I mean? A lot of sick ass wrestlers from Turkey and stuff are out here, you know what I mean?

00:04:07:13 - 00:04:26:14
Unknown
And it changes the way that jujitsu gets executed, you know? I mean, because the entry point becomes different, right? Like a Dagestan is going to grapple different than a judoka. You know what I mean? And if these things like making what the standup game of of the UK is, then it changes everything. So it's really powerful. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:04:26:15 - 00:04:50:13
Unknown
That sounds cool. Yeah. I mean, Fiona, the frickin phenom right now is from the UK. From Wales? Yeah. Yeah. And plus they have the, the Polaris Pro, which is just an amazing series where they really try to like, highlight and showcase women but just like justifies themselves are very high, high energy. The crowds, they get it, you know what I mean?

00:04:50:13 - 00:05:19:13
Unknown
Like it's. Yeah, it's really cool. Yeah man that's. I haven't been to England in so long. I did I, I went once with my mom in my twenties. I'm almost, you know, 40 now.

it in a lot of ways. So that was the beginning of me finding myself in jujitsu,

00:08:12:17 - 00:08:28:23

meaning that, you know, of course, you know, start to have Gracie go to trials, finish with, you know, with heroes, get my get my black belt, you know what I'm saying? Then start teaching over at house and then get the opportunities here in the UK with Gracie.

00:08:28:23 - 00:08:49:21
Unknown
But how Roundhay, Leeds and everything out here. And so, you know, it's been really just kind of fantastic. But, you know, I can't tell you how much legitimacy working at the San Bruno UFC gym has for me anywhere else that I went in the world. You know what I mean? When they were like, Well, where have you taught it?

00:08:49:21 - 00:09:10:12
Unknown
And I'd be like, Well, UFC, GM, San Bruno, they like you talk to UFC gym now. Obviously they know it's not like Vegas, you feel me, but it's still, you know what I mean? And for me, you know, the the format was so open at the San Bruno spot that I had to decide how do I really want warmups to go?

00:09:10:14 - 00:09:27:24
Unknown
What does it really mean? Have a warm up, You know, I mean, especially when you come from how grace is, where they try to break your soul before you even touch anybody. You know what I mean? So how how heavy? What? The warm ups. How light do I want the warm ups? What? You know what I mean. And then that led to me getting the shot to be over at USF, where I taught for a while.
