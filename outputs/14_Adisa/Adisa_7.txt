 a reflection of you. And so when I'm talking to these guys as the one that's supposed to be the facilitator, and they're reflecting all this beauty to me that I didn't expect, that I that I didn't even show up for.

You know, we'll have our thing going on tomorrow. You know, we rotate between like deep stoic conversations and open conversations and this upcoming one is open. So I'm just looking forward to seeing what everybody's been up to. You know, it's a wide group of people, like some dudes are like attorneys for large acquisition and merger corporations and other guys are like sound bath crystal, like Masters and others are college students and others are business leaders and others are artists.

So again, if you go to at Bishop Chronicles, you can learn how to sign up and be a part of it. And I'm working on setting up the American group like within the next few weeks, like by later than like mid-October, we should have the American RMG up and running.

You know what? I'm going to leave everybody with this. Do not underestimate the power of meditation and prayer do not underestimate the power of meditation and prayer. I it is a big deal. Meditation and prayer has really got me through a lot of stuff. And beyond that, I'm going to say, if you have beef with anybody or somebody's got beef with you, seek forgiveness.

01:21:38:09 - 01:22:07:04

Be willing to apologize and and be willing to listen more because life is short, man. Life is short I've lost more people in my life in the last three years than in all the years before. Sometimes, you know, situations like cancer, you know, or other diseases that were that were that were foreseeable, sometimes very sudden right. But like, life is really short.

01:22:07:04 - 01:22:28:21

And sometimes people be holding grudges because they have this illusion of time. Like, I'll let it go in a few years, man. You don't know, if you're going to be here tomorrow, you don't know if that person is going to be here tomorrow. And like I've seen it happen where people think like they can hold this grudge until X happens and then something happens and that that never that beast never gets squashed, right?

01:22:28:22 - 01:22:50:29

Only your ego lets you do that. So lean into meditation and prayer and embrace forgiveness because life is short and, you know, I don't God be for nobody, you know what I'm saying? I used to I used to be mad at people and I'm I just don't have the space to be angry anymore. I might not be happy.

01:22:50:29 - 01:23:06:11

I may have lost some respect. I may not necessarily want to be in contact with you, but that doesn't mean that I have beef with you. It doesn't. It doesn't mean that I'm happy with you. It just means that your energy and the way that we engage is not healthy. That's all that means. You know what I mean?

01:23:06:15 - 01:23:21:11

And if we can find a way for it to be healthy, I'm always that door is always open for me. You know what I mean? And I'm not always the best person my damn self, you know what I mean? So I know there's aspects of me that some people, you know, are just don't want to deal with. And that's that's that's fair too, you know what I mean?

01:23:21:11 - 01:23:43:04

Like, we're all an acquired taste, you know what I mean? To some degree, we're all an acquired taste to some degree, Right. But I don't have be for nobody. Embrace your joy, embrace your peace, Look into meditation and prayer. Do it consistently. And, you know, Google Jiu-Jitsu near me. That's what you need to do and embrace your future.
