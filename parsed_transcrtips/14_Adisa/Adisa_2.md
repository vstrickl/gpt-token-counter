 to make it pop up soon.

00:11:18:13 - 00:11:34:21

And everybody who's going, you keep saying that and I don't. And I agree. I agree. I've been dragging. But I've been dragging because I've been living and trying to figure out, you know, what exactly am I doing with the podcast and what kind of content do I want to deliver. But the Resilient Men's Group was kind of born from that.

00:11:34:21 - 00:11:58:06

And so what it's about is, you know, I got into the stoicism because I had a near-death experience, and then right after that I ended up getting divorced. And so like that whole situation shook up my sense of my identity. Like, I really didn't know who I was because I had been married for 23 years and I had known her for 30 years.

00:11:58:06 - 00:12:23:11

Right. And I'm 53, so I more than half of my life like, who am I? Like, if I'm not married and if I'm not, you know what I mean? Around my kids all the time. Like, who am I? And so it took me a while and Stoicism played a significant role in me finding myself. My direct link in the stoicism actually comes through jujitsu through a guy named Abraham Marti shout out to the Dominican Republic, who he was doing a seminar at Heroes.

00:12:23:11 - 00:12:42:01

I was supposed to go meet with him and my split happened, like right before the weekend he arrived and he was expecting me to be there to interview him. I was like messed up. I was not at the interview. A nobody. And he was like, Bro, he called like, Where are you at? And I was like, I'm having a split.

00:12:42:01 - 00:12:53:28

It's a bad time to go. And then he was like, Bro, you got to be more stoic. And I was like, What? He was like, You got to be more stoic. And I was like, What does that mean? Like, I don't I don't know what that means. And he was like, Man, you know, you got to look into it.

00:12:53:28 - 00:13:09:04

But, you know, bottom line is, my life isn't perfect either. I got all this other stuff going on, but I'm here and I'm training and you need to be here. You need to be training. Now, we're not doing the interview. And so when I got off the phone, I immediately went on a YouTube and started looking at Stoicism, which is something I never really did.

00:13:09:04 - 00:13:32:28

I never really used YouTube before then to find out a thing. But obviously YouTube had tons of different cool things on Stoicism, and that led to me just diving into the wormhole of that philosophy system. And what a lot of people don't know is because of people like, you know. AK Black, also known as Jim Wilson over there at Physique Man, it's like I got into reading about philosophy at a really early age.

00:13:32:28 - 00:14:04:08

So I had read a lot of the Pre-socratic stuff. I read Aristotle, I had read Plato, I had read lots of Eastern and Western philosophy like in Depth, Confucianism, Daoism, you know what I mean? Lots of different stuff. So it was easier for me, I think, to understand stoic philosophy. I don't want to say better than others. I'll just say because of all the philosophy I had been reading, it was easy to understand and I became a serious believer in the way that philosophy works, which is around a lot of practice.

00:14:04:10 - 00:14:28:17

Like it's not that stoic ideas are cool because you'll find people online who quote Marcus Aurelius or Seneca or whatever, but it's really that like they have different practices for different things you're trying to do. So if you struggle with fear, they are stoic practices for fear. If you if you struggle with anger management, they have ways to curb your anger, sadness, ways to like, look at your sadness in a better perspective so that you're not harming yourself.

00:14:28:17 - 00:14:45:25

You know what I mean? I know a lot of people that cut themselves that you know what I mean? That I've tried to kill themselves, you know, even recently and stuff like that. Right. And even even express your joy in moderation. Right. Like, it's not that you're not a joyful person, but like, let's take let's take just the bay, for example.

00:14:46:01 - 00:15:18:07

Right. If if the 40 Niners lose the Super Bowl stuff going to be on fire. Right. If they win a Super Bowl stuff on the on fire. So these are two different extreme expressions of anger and joy. Right. So it's about moderation. And once I started doing those practices, my life just became much better. And I started studying it so heavily that within a few years I was able to like lecture at it at Stanford University, which was amazing, you know?

00:15:18:09 - 00:15:38:21

And then they invited me back to do another talk. And I just recently did a talk out here in the UK, I think called the next 45, which is created by this amazing guy named Mike Bates, who is is the is the owner of the school that I do some work at right now called Gracie Bar Roundhay Leeds.

00:15:38:23 - 00:15:56:05

It's an amazing school. They have 500 students, 500 like this school is big and it's rapidly growing. Yeah, I know, but this guy is amazing. And he created this thing called the next 45, where people get to 45, they start falling off, thinking their lives over, thinking they're done. And he's like, No, you got to look at the next 45.

00:15:56:08 - 00:16:17:29

And so he invited me to be the keynote speaker at this men's retreat, and it was fantastic. But one of the reasons he invited me to do this men's retreat and be the keynote speaker was because I had been doing the Resilient Men's Group, which is a group where men from all backgrounds all over the UK show up and we have different conversations around what's bothering us.

00:16:18:06 - 00:16:42:24

And then what I do is I weave stoic solutions into the conversations. It's stoic practices, right? And it's been going really, really good. So, you know, if anybody is interested in joining the Resilient Men's group, just follow me on Instagram at Bishop Chronicles. If you follow me at Bishop Chronicles, the links to get on and be a part of it are really amazing.

00:16:42:26 - 00:17:03:18

And you know, it's a beautiful time. I'm going to be coming to the Bay Area soon and be able to hang out and I may do some resume and stuff while I'm there. We'll see. But it's a beautiful time and I'm grateful to be be helping men help themselves be better men. Like I'm really working to make sure that people are not trying to follow me.

00:17:03:20 - 00:17:30:26

I'm helping a resilient men's group to help introduce them to themselves. Right. Like I know that I am, you know, a teacher of jujitsu. I'm a teacher of meditation. I'm a teacher of chess. Right. And I have a group called 64 blocks, which is about that fusion. But really, the the reason why I'm slow to do a lot of stuff is because I don't want people following me.

00:17:30:28 - 00:17:50:29

I want them following themselves, their own heart, their own mind, their own aspirations, their own goals. I don't want them to be like me. I want them to be like themselves and the only reason I introduce and push stoic philosophy, meditation and chess and jujitsu is because these are tools that I believe introduce the individual to who they naturally are.

00:17:51:01 - 00:18:08:29

Right? So I don't want a carbon copy of me. I tell my students all the time, Don't be trying to move like me on the mat. I'm going to give you a foundation and a blueprint of how to move, but I will introduce you to jiu jitsu. But you will introduce me to your jujitsu based off your body type, your mindset, your in your creativity.

00:18:08:29 - 00:18:35:07

Right being a replica of me isn't what I need on the mat, and it's not what the world needs. That's a beautiful desire. And yeah, I mean, we can only teach from what our own personal experience is and what we know We can't teach from outside of those things. And so I think you just reinforcing, hey, this is, this is what I know, this is how I can teach you to help you build your foundation.

00:18:35:10 - 00:19:05:15

But really this path is your own. Make it your own. Don't be me. I love that. And I think it's a lot different than the traditional ways that martial arts has been taught and how it's been taught to us. And I also really want to just go back and re-emphasize, you know, how the reason why have you on and talking about the Resilient Men's project is because mental health is a very important subject to me.

00:19:05:18 - 00:19:40:26

And I think that men don't find it easy for them to have a group or a person where they can actually be authentic and share the expressed their emotions. Because I think it's pushed, you know, society tries to condition a sense of toughness out of them. So any type of weaknesses or vulnerability is seen as a weakness. And I think, you know, we've had some really great men that we thought were on top of their game to take their own lives.

00:19:40:28 - 00:20:02:15

And to me, I just find it heartbreaking to hear that, you know, that like I there's a lot of great, wonderful men in my life who I want them to know. You know, sometimes mine is an ass, but she loves you, you know? Come to me and talk to me about anything because I want to see you here.

00:20:02:15 - 00:20:36:14

Even on the days that you might be pissing me off. Right? Still wants you to be here with us. So. Yeah, you know, as a no. Yeah. No, I appreciate that. You know, I think that, you know, men do struggle. I think that, you know, everywhere. But especially, I think like in the West, meaning like, you know, America and in the UK and, you know, most of the world of real black men are not encouraged to show anything but toughness.

00:20:36:17 - 00:21:09:20

Right. But what happens is, is a lot of that so-called toughness leads to alcoholism, leads to a lot of drug use, leads to a lot of self-harm in soft ways and in slow ways that don't look as painful as they end up. Right? So you have guys that, you know, work themselves to death, just to death, eat themselves into an early grave because they're not really willing to just say, you know what, this isn't the life that I want or this hurts too much or I endured this thing that I can't shake.

00:21:09:22 - 00:21:28:12

You know what I mean? So the Resilient Men's group is meant for dudes to show up, say their truths, deal without judgment, you know what I'm saying? And express their pain and their joy and their confusion. You know what I mean? Sometimes just confused about what they want to do with themselves or how they got to wherever they are in their life.

00:21:28:19 - 00:21:52:29

And that's all okay, right? That's all okay. You know, like yeah, So yeah, so, you know, we have open conversation and then I sprinkle in a little stoicism, you know, and it's working really well, you know, and I'm I'm trying to get one started in America. And so that's one of the things that I'm going to do when I come out there, hopefully is set up some resilient men's group events while I'm there and, you know, keep it going.

00:21:52:29 - 00:22:22:24

But, you know, mental health is really important. And, you know, I appreciate you for for even even caring because, you know, it's been more than one occasion where sometimes people in jujitsu, like they've reached out to me about stuff. But I didn't really know, you know, like this one guy, many years ago. I bet you this is over ten years ago, this one guy hit me up because I had posted this thing called The Book of Forgiving by Archbishop Desmond Tutu and his daughter.

00:22:23:02 - 00:22:40:26

And it's about how after dealing with very heavy things, people were able to forgive. And it talks about the science in forgiving. What does forgiveness due to the human body? What does it do to the human brain? That's what this book is about. So he hit me up and he was like, amen. And looks like a pretty cool book.

00:22:40:26 - 00:22:54:04

And I was like, Yeah, that is a good book, man. You should get it. And after you read it, talk with me. He was like, Okay. He was like, Yeah, I've been going through some stuff, but he really, you know, he, he kept it really mellow. And then I didn't really follow up because, you know, I didn't really know him.

00:22:54:04 - 00:23:12:13

We just talked nominally. I might see him at class once in a while, and then one day he took his own life and I was totally I was like, was he asking for help? I didn't read it, but he didn't really ask for help, you know what I mean? He was just saying whatever. And that was just like, dang.

00:23:12:13 - 00:23:35:20

And so, you know, it's a it's a hard road and we all suffer, you know what I mean? And like, I saw this really interesting conversation online and it was about in a world where people aren't getting married as much and most kids are getting raised in households without a dad. Like do fathers actually matter? And it was a strange, really cool quote by this psychologist.

00:23:35:26 - 00:24:06:26

And she was basically saying that like the ultimately that the value of any father is rooted in the mental health of that parent. Right. So like, if the dad is not mentally healthy, it might be worse if he's around. Yeah, right. And it's really deep, right. That like the quality of the father ultimately is based on the mental health of the father and the quality of
