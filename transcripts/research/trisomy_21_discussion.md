This study identifies the first association between ad- vancing maternal age and location of genetic recombi- nation, the two most important risk factors for chro- mosome 21 nondisjunction that have been identified. Altered patterns of recombination appear to exert their greatest effects on nondisjunction at a younger age. As women age, the proportion of trisomic cases exhibit- ing susceptible exchange configurations decreases and, among the oldest group, the distribution of exchange
placement moves strikingly in the direction of that ob- served among a normally disjoining sample.
We postulate that multiple risk factors, some age dependent and others age independent, lead to nondis- junction. In a young woman, meiotic machinery (spin- dles, sister-chromatid adhesive proteins, microtubule mo- tor proteins, etc.) functions optimally and correctly segregates all but the most susceptible exchange config- urations (achiasmate bivalents and exchanges close to either the centromere or the telomere). For young women, then, the greatest risk factor for nondisjunction is the presence of a susceptible exchange pattern in the oocyte.
As a woman ages, her meiotic machinery accumulates the effects of years of environmental and age-related insults, becoming less efficient and/or more error prone. Suboptimal exchange bivalents are still susceptible to nondisjunction, but even correctly placed bivalents are now at risk. The proportion of nondisjunctions occur- ring among oocytes with normal exchange configura- tions increases over time as age-dependent risk factors exert their influence. As a result, the most prevalent exchange profile of nondisjoined oocytes shifts from susceptible to nonsusceptible patterns.
How should these results be viewed against the back- drop of previous studies of maternal age and trisomy? For maternal trisomies 15 and 18 and the maternal sex- chromosome trisomies, maternal age was higher among the cases in which recombination was present compared with the cases in which no recombination was observed (Bugge et al. 1998; Robinson et al. 1998; Thomas et al. 2001). There exists no such age difference among the trisomy 21 population. Rather, the placement of recom- bination appears to differ with maternal age. As has been noted elsewhere (Hassold and Hunt 2001), whereas al- tered recombination appears to be a common risk factor for nondisjunction, the magnitude and direction of the alteration seems to vary with the chromosome involved.
These data should also be considered in light of the recent report suggesting the possible presence of stem cells within the mammalian ovary (Johnson et al. 2004).
If these stem cells are present, it would suggest that some oocytes are relative newcomers to the ovary, escaping many of the insults that have accumulated over time. The strength of the maternal age effect, however, in- dicates that a large proportion of oocytes in the aged ovary are undergoing nondisjunction. It is possible that the number of newly created oocytes comprises only a small fraction of the ovary. Alternately, these oocytes may themselves be damaged or susceptible to the aged ovarian environment.
Although maternal MI–derived nondisjunction is a predominant feature of most trisomy, MII–type errors also play an important role, comprising 30% of ma- ternal trisomy 21. Previous studies of these errors also show an association with altered recombination (Lamb et al. 1996), leading to the suggestion that these errors may have actually originated in MI. Although the over- all number of MII cases is too small for conclusive find- ings, preliminary studies have been initiated in the search for an association with maternal age. Interest- ingly, trisomy 21 resulting from MII-type errors shows an increase in the amount of meiotic exchange with increasing maternal age. The numbers are too small to describe overall spatial distribution with age. Whether these results are robust remains to be seen, but, at the moment, it appears that maternal age may be associated with MII-type trisomy as well.
A limitation of our analysis concerns the inability to subdivide the normally disjoining sample on the basis of maternal age. However, the maternal age effect on genomewide recombination is likely several orders of magnitude lower than the effect on trisomic cases—in fact, its detection required the use of nearly 15,000 mei- otic events and only translated into two additional re- combinants genomewide across the maternal reproduc- tive lifespan (Kong et al. 2004).
The finding of an association between maternal age and meiotic exchange placement has important impli- cations in the search for additional risk factors of non- disjunction. Our data suggest that the lack of recom- bination or the altered placement of recombination is a major risk factor, especially among younger women. This observation, together with the altered frequency of recombination noted among trisomies of chromosomes 15, 18, and X, provides a unifying hypothesis: the pres- ence of recombination located medially along the chro-
mosome protects the tetrad against the effects of the aging ovarian environment. The identification of mech- anisms that determine recombination frequency and lo- cation is the next key step in understanding the process of chromosome nondisjunction.
